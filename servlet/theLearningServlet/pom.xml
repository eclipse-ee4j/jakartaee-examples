    <!-- This is the Project Object Model known as the pom.xml file. It provides 
         all the configuration for a single project. In my courses I usually 
         distribute a parent pom file with the basic configuration that my 
         students include in their local pom files where they add 
         additional components based on their work. Later examples in this series
         will use this technique. The pom file is complete
