        <title>SessionScoped example</title>
    </h:head>
    <h:body>
        <p>
            As this example uses a SessionScoped bean you will see the time
            below change once and then only after a new session has been
            created.
        </p>
        <p>
            The session timeout has been set to 1 minute, so refresh your page
            1 minute after your last refresh and you will see the time update.
        </p>
